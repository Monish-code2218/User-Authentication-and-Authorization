# User Authentication and Authorization with Bearer Token in Node.js

I created this project from scratch to provide a comprehensive solution for building secure User Authentication and Authorization with Bearer Token in Node.js with Express.
The API allows users to perform the following actions securely:


- user register
- user login
- Show user info

# Things I Learned and Implemented in This Project:

- ### MVC Framework:
  *Structured the project using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, separating concerns for better organization and scalability.*

- ### Creating and Using Middlewares:
  *Implemented custom middlewares to handle authentication, validation, and other tasks within the Express.js application.*

- ### JWT for Authentication:
  *Utilized JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication, enabling stateless authentication across HTTP requests.*

- ### Separate File Routes:
  *Organized routes into separate files to keep the codebase clean and manageable, following the modular architecture.*

- ### Mongoose and MongoDB Database:
  *Integrated Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, to interact with the database and define schemas.*

- ### bcrypt :
  *Used bcrypt, a library for hashing passwords and other sensitive information, to enhance security.*

- ### dotenv:
  *Employed dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file, facilitating secure configuration management.*


# How does this APIs works ?, you can test it using PostMan !!
